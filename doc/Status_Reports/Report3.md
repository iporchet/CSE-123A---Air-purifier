# Status Report 3

Summary
  - Created github project: https://github.com/users/iporchet/projects/1
 

Individual Work
- **Ryan**

- **Randall**
- Worked on:

	-During this period, the team finalized the system architecture for the air purifier and clarified hardware responsibilities. We completed the selection process for the primary sensing components, focusing on particulate matter sensors and environmental sensors to ensure accurate air quality monitoring.
	-We researched and compared microcontroller options and confirmed the use of the ESP32 due to its integrated Wi-Fi, sufficient processing capability, and low power consumption. Initial firmware development has begun, including:
  	-Establishing serial communication between the ESP32 and the PM sensor

  	-Testing sensor data acquisition and validating output ranges
  
- 	Future Work:
	- The next phase will focus on system integration and performance optimization. Key objectives include:

	-Integrating the PM sensor with real-time fan control logic

	-Implementing a closed-loop control system where fan speed adjusts automatically based on detected air quality

- **Andrew**
	- Workded on:
		- Drafted a mock test plan for reduction of particle matter effectiveness.
	- Future Work:
 		- Refine Formal and Null Hypotheses
   		- Figure out administrative details (location & time)
     	- Draft other test plans for additional configurartions
		- Add to github backlog

- **Isaiah**
	
- **Eduardo Dominguez-Sotelo**
	   
- **Ugo**
    - Worked on:
        - Did research on the air purfiers in the market to create a well informed design objective. 
    - Future work:
        - Create a decision table 
        - Design how the MCU will interact with other devices
