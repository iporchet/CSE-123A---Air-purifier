# Status Report 3

Summary
  - Created github project: https://github.com/users/iporchet/projects/1
  - Sent BOM to BELS and collected parts that they already had. This included ESP32c3, RPi4, breakout board, barrel jack converter.
  - Learned how to use KANBAN boards on github. 
  - Created high level schematic of air purifier
 

Individual Work

- **Ryan**
	- Worked on:
		- Created bill of materials and submitted it to BELS.
		- Went to BELS to get parts that they already had. (ESP32c3, RPi4, breakout board, barrel jack converter)
		- Created skeleton code for esp32c3 firmware.
		- Created tasks for backlog
	- Future Work:
	 	- Add more tasks to backlog
		- Do more research on other air purifiers
		- Create skeleton code for app and server.
		- research cloud servers (AWS, Azure, etc.)
	

- **Randall**
- Worked on:

 -During this period, the team finalized the system architecture for the air purifier and clarified hardware responsibilities. We completed the selection process for the primary sensing components.
 -We researched and compared microcontroller options and confirmed the use of the ESP32 due to its integrated Wi-Fi, and sufficient processing capability.
  
- Future Work:
  - The next phase will focus on system integration and performance optimization. Key objectives include:

 -Integrating the PM sensor with real-time fan control logic

 -Implementing a closed-loop control system where fan speed adjusts automatically based on detected air quality

- **Andrew**
  - Workded on:
    - Drafted a mock test plan for reduction of particle matter effectiveness.
  - Future Work:
  - Refine Formal and Null Hypotheses
  - Figure out administrative details (location & time)
  - Draft other test plans for additional configurartions
    - Add to github backlog

- **Isaiah**
  - Worked on:
    - Drafted different model configurations to use for testing the air purifier's efficiency (ie. Air intake/outake, filter placement, dust screens)
    - started printing enclosure parts for testing
  - Future work:
    - Work on part variations for how the fan's and filter are placed
    - Continue printing enclosure parts

- **Eduardo Dominguez-Sotelo**
    - Worked on:
      - Did research on other DIY air purifiers people have made on their own.
      - Did research on potential ways to host our mobile app/web app.
    - Future Work:
      - Set up a template for the application
      - Add work to the backlog
      - Document each step more effectively
- **Ugo**
    - Worked on:
        - Did research on the air purfiers in the market to create a well informed design objective. 
    - Future work:
        - Create a decision table 
        - Design how the MCU will interact with other devices
