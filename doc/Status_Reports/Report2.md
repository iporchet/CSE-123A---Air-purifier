# Status Report 2

- [ ] Summary
  - Created github repository: https://github.com/iporchet/CSE-123A---Air-purifier.git
  - Created Gaant Chart: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ui5CqO9LXlo5OME9tFne_e-ai2fUoh3hpXCWUBuXLiE/edit?usp=sharing
  - Created materials list for BELS: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWfhZ2uXgKavHA7v_1cHkHFb3r9jW6XS7nkruinW5m0/edit?usp=sharing

  This week we made design decisions as a group about what microcontroller we should use, whether we should host a server on device or through a PC in another location, and what parts we should request from BELS.

    - What I did: Added specific links to Arctic P12 Max fans and HEPA H13 Filters to materials list. Completed research on power supply for 2 Arctic P12 fans, RaspberryPi4, and esp32s3 microcontroller. Added links to power supply, buck regulator, jack to screw terminal block, and step down voltage regulator.
    - What I plan to do next: Begin work on psuedo code for the microcontroller and fan logic. Begin work on official documentation.

      Moved forward from using the PSM5003 to using a different senors which is cheaper and can measure 4 different measurements. This senors is going to be paired with the ESP-S3 and possibly with the raspberry pi in order to establish a connect over bluetooth or wifi. 

Going to move forward with documentation and with the coding aspect of the project. Want to see how I can help and learn with CAD and with the 3-D printing part aswell.

      More research into consumer data sheets to prep for our design documentation. Also begin thinking of mock test plans.

	Did research on the SEN54. Created a schematic for conceptualization. This was a small drawing with components pointing to each other, showing the flow of the air purifier and the electronics outside of the purifier. This is just an overall schematic and doesn’t go into detail about specific placement. My goals are to keep researching how to implement sensor readings from the sen54, specifically, and research how our mobile app can interact with our Raspberry Pi/microcontroller.
