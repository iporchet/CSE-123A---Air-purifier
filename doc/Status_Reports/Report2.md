    - What I did: Added specific links to Arctic P12 Max fans and HEPA H13 Filters to materials list. Completed research on power supply for 2 Arctic P12 fans, RaspberryPi4, and esp32s3 microcontroller. Added links to power supply, buck regulator, jack to screw terminal block, and step down voltage regulator.
    - What I plan to do next: Begin work on psuedo code for the microcontroller and fan logic. Begin work on official documentation.

      Moved forward from using the PSM5003 to using a different senors which is cheaper and can measure 4 different measurements. This senors is going to be paired with the ESP-S3 and possibly with the raspberry pi in order to establish a connect over bluetooth or wifi. 

Going to move forward with documentation and with the coding aspect of the project. Want to see how I can help and learn with CAD and with the 3-D printing part aswell.

      More research into consumer data sheets to prep for our design documentation. Also begin thinking of mock test plans.
