# Status Report 2

- [ ] Summary
  - Created github repository: https://github.com/iporchet/CSE-123A---Air-purifier.git
  - Created Gaant Chart: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ui5CqO9LXlo5OME9tFne_e-ai2fUoh3hpXCWUBuXLiE/edit?usp=sharing
  - Created materials list for BELS: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZWfhZ2uXgKavHA7v_1cHkHFb3r9jW6XS7nkruinW5m0/edit?usp=sharing

  This week we made design decisions as a group about what microcontroller we should use, whether we should host a server on device or through a PC in another location, and what parts we should request from BELS.

  - **Ryan**
    - What I did: Added specific links to Arctic P12 Max fans and HEPA H13 Filters to materials list. Completed research on power supply for 2 Arctic P12 fans, RaspberryPi4, and esp32s3 microcontroller. Added links to power supply, buck regulator, jack to screw terminal block, and step down voltage regulator.
    - What I plan to do next: Begin work on psuedo code for the microcontroller and fan logic. Begin work on official documentation.

      More research into consumer data sheets to prep for our design documentation. Also begin thinking of mock test plans.
