# Design Objectives

Design an efficient, autonomous smart air purifier that reports air quality statistics, can dynamically adjust filtration based on pollutant levels (Particulate Matter), has a reasonable noise level, and is easily maintainable for hobbyists and classrooms.

## Measurable Targets

| Design Objective | Units | Target / Range |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Manufacturing Cost | USD ($) | $60 - $100 |
| Target Air Quality (PM) | AQI | < 50 |
| Noise Level | Decibels (dB) | 35 - 50 |
| Filter Replacement Time | Minutes | < 1 |
| Filter Lifespan | Hours | 2000 - 8000 |
